# TracerDenseSingleFile

This repository provides the Mathematica notebooks for computing the cumulants of a tracer in the dense SEP. See the associated paper: Poncet, Grabsch & BÃ©nichou, "Full stochastic dynamics of a tracer in a dense single-file system" (2025) [arXiv:2505.21446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21446).

## List of files
- `defs_and_integrals.nb`: Provides the basic definitions and the integrals necessary for the other notebooks. Upon saving, Mathematica automatically generates the package `defs_and_integrals.m` that can later be loaded in another notebook.
- `defs_and_integrals.m`: This file is provided for completeness. It is automatically generated by Mathematica when saving `defs_and_integrals.nb`.
- `test_integrals.nb`: Notebook for testing numerically the integrals provided by `defs_and_integrals.m`.
- `cumulants_unbiased.nb`: Computes the unbiased annealed and quenched cumulants. Includes the case of a step intial condition.
- `cumulants_biased.nb`: Computes the biased annealed and quenched cumulants.
